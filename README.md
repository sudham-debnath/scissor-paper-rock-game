# Scissors, Paper, Rock | Python Game
### The game will ask the user to choose between rock, paper and scissors. Once the user enters their choice, the code will randomly choose one of those options as the computer's turn. The code then prints out the chosen option and the user's choice. Finally, it loops back to ask for another choice from the user.
